# pytest-score


A plugin to run scoring (non-binary) tests with pytest.


## Features
The plugin provides a fixture ``score`` which can be used to score the result of a test. The plugin creates HTML and terminal output.

Note that the plugin is in a very early state, meaning that some features are still missing. In particular, configuration options (e.g. for choosing the type of output) have not yet been implemented.
